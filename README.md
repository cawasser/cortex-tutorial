# Gorilla REPL

This tutorial takes advantage of the very cool [Gorilla REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org/).

Gorilla REPL provides an interactive "notebook" in the browser, where you can experiment
with Clojure code and see the result right there on the page. [Here is a short intro video.](https://vimeo.com/87118206)

For more details on how to use Gorilla REPL, scroll down to "Editor Commands" on the [Getting started](http://gorilla-repl.org/start.html) page.
General, `alt-g alt-g` will get you to a popup that has all the command and you can text search for what you want to do.

# Use, plot, Re-train Notebook

This page _uses_ the network we trained earlier and plots the results of some trials, as well as a comparison between the
"actual" results and the "computed" results.
